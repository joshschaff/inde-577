# INDE 577 - Data Science and Machine Learning


This repository covers a graduate-level industrial engineering course on the fundamentals of data science and machine learning. It explores implentations of 10 different machine learning techniques on a real world dataset.

## The Data

The dataset used throughout the repository is provided by [Rice Bikes](bikes.rice.edu), a student run business at Rice University. It may not be distributed or reproduced in any manner without the explicit [permission of the business](mailto:ricebikes@gmail.com). Please see [here](data/README.md) for more information about the dataset and the features used in this repository.
